      I implemented and compared several deep neural networks architectures to see how well they can
      detect phishing web pages. They were trained and evaluated on a combination of several datasets.

      <p>I co-founded Nivad Cloud startup as a BaaS solution offering secure in-app purchase as its first and 
      most successful and innovative service. I learned and practiced a huge deal of soft skills while 
      managing this project ranging from negotiations, to conflict resolution, to making engaging presentation, 
      to customer, to basic financial management, and how NOT to wear too many hats (in a hard way). We sponsored
      PyCon in Tehran as well as a nation-wide hackathon which I did the negotiations for. In addition, 
      I made a great progress in my technical skills as well. I designed and developed the RESTful API up to 
      best practices and the industry standards, created the front-end and backend of the management dashboard, 
      designed the database, and deployed the service on the servers. I had an amazing journy from starting 
      a hobby side project to growing it into a sucessful startup serving thousands of customers in production.</p>
      
      <p>From a technical view also I had an amazing learning experience in a variety of backend development and
      maintenance as well. I learned how to set up an Nginx reverse proxy, keep services alive on docker,
      and how to manage SSL certificates. I had to separate API and the users' dashboard separate to achieve a
      higher availablity and a much higher performance for the API. I learned how to properly use redis key-value
      store to lower the overheads on API calls to make them as fast as possible without losing any accounting data.
      I also used it to cache the results of sluggish queries. I learned how to leverage Celery to run computationally
      intensive tasks asynchronously as well as running periodic tasks such as issuing invoices and processing 
      transactions in the end of the day. </p>

      <p>This is one of the most influencial projects on my professional path. I gained a great deal of technical 
      skills and soft skills. But more importantly I expanded my network, came out of my bubble and communicated 
      with people of quite different backgrounds (as customers, investors, job applicants, etc). I developed an 
      strong entrepreneurial/business vision which even helped me to be successful in the stock market today. I 
      got some of my experiences in Nivad in `the hard way' which might have hurt the business at the time, but
      I came out of them stronger and wiser.</p>
