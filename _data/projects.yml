    <p>I implemented and compared several deep neural networks architectures to see how well they can
    detect phishing web pages. They were trained and evaluated on a combination of several datasets.</p>

    <p>In this project I experimented with embeddings (word level and character level), RNNs using GRU cells,
    and convolutions. The data came from multiple sources, so I developed a simple pipleline to merge
    the data sets and perform the cleaning on the go.

    <p>More details are available in the repostory's readme and the 1-page extended abstract.</p>

    <p>I co-founded Nivad Cloud startup as a BaaS solution offering secure in-app purchases as its first and 
    most successful and innovative service. I learned and practiced a huge deal of soft skills while 
    managing this project ranging from negotiations, to conflict resolution, to making engaging presentations, 
    to customers, to basic financial management, and how to wear multiple hats but not too many. We sponsored
    PyCon in Tehran as well as a nation-wide hackathon which I did the negotiations for. Also, 
    I made great progress in my technical skills as well. I designed and developed the RESTful API up to 
    best practices and the industry standards, created the front-end and backend of the management dashboard, 
    designed the database, and deployed the service on the servers. I had an amazing journey from starting 
    a hobby side project to growing it into a successful startup serving thousands of customers in production.</p>
    
    <p>From a technical view I had an amazing learning experience in a variety of backend development and
    maintenance as well. I learned how to set up an Nginx reverse proxy, keep services alive on docker,
    and how to manage SSL certificates. I had to separate API and the users' dashboard separate to achieve
    higher availability and much higher performance for the API. I learned how to properly use redis key-value
    store to lower the overheads on API calls to make them as fast as possible without losing any accounting data.
    I also used it to cache the results of sluggish queries. I learned how to leverage Celery to run computationally
    intensive tasks asynchronously as well as running periodic tasks such as issuing invoices and processing 
    transactions at the end of the day. </p>

    <p>This is one of the most influential projects on my professional path. I gained plenty of technical 
    skills and soft skills. But more importantly, I expanded my network, came out of my bubble and communicated 
    with people of quite different backgrounds (as customers, investors, job applicants, etc). I developed a 
    strong entrepreneurial/business vision which even helped me to be successful in the stock market today. I 
    got some of my experiences in Nivad in `the hard way' which might have hurt the business at the time, but
    I came out of them stronger and wiser.</p>
