    <p>I implemented and compared several deep neural network architectures to see how well they can
    detect phishing web pages. They were trained and evaluated on a combination of several datasets.</p>

    <p>In this project, I experimented with embeddings (word level and character level), RNNs using GRU cells,
    and convolutions. The data came from multiple sources, so I developed a simple pipeline to merge
    the data sets and perform the cleaning on the go. Keras's functional API played an important role in
    these architectures' implementation.

    <p>This is a project I did as my MSc project for <a href="https://www.micropilot.com/" target="_new" rel="nofollow">MicroPilot Inc</a>, to generate a state model of their UAV auto-pilot software for 
    testing and verification. I created a deep neural network a hybrid of convolutional and recurrent layers,
    that takes as input the values of auto-pilot's inputs and outputs (sensor readings and servo outputs) and 
    predicts the state of the system. Although I had access to the 500k LOC code base of the auto-pilot, we
    decided to develop this method as a more generalizable and more useful black-box method where access to 
    the internals is not assumed. </p>

    <p>This project was quite a journey, a hands-on learning opportunity for me. Data collection, data cleaning,
    and storage made a major part of the project. It was an industry collaboration where standardized datasets
    are not available. The architecture was inspired by several similar tasks such as human activity recognition
    and image segmentation. The evaluation part was also a bit challenging and I had to implement a variation of
    precision, recall, and F1 Score.</p>

    <p>On the implementation side, I had a lot to learn too. I learned how to compile TensorFlow to use GPU on my
    machine. I used a pipeline of python generators fed into TensorFlow's DataSet API to optimize for best memory
    utilization and computational performance. I created a custom layer in Keras to properly handle masking of 
    the padding zeros. I also learned to create custom loss functions and custom validation metrics.</p>

    <p>A conference paper with more details on this project's implementation and results is under review as of
    now.</p>

    <p>This project started in March 2019 in the Neuro Nexus hackathon. I was in the team until May that year when the project
    finished, afterwards, I decided to leave the team for several reasons. We created a tool to assist laboratories 
    and clinicians with translating pharmacogenomic testing results into clinically useful recommendations. The recommendations
    are based on expert guidelines developed by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Royal 
    Dutch Association for the Advancements of Pharmacy - Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG). </p>

    <p>This project was my first Canadian leadership experience which boosted my confidence to work in a professional international
    environment. In the first meeting we had, I took the initiative, using my experience with Nivad Cloud, to lead a brainstorming
    session to come up with a solution, set the goals and milestones, and assign tasks to team members. We decided to create an
    <a href="https://sequence2script.github.io/" target="_new">online tool</a> with an intuitive and simple interface for clinicians
    and laboratories to use. <a href="https://github.com/sequence2script/sequence2script.github.io">Masoud</a> and Patrick 
    designed and implemented the front-end and the report structure with input from the product owner (also called challenge champion),
    Dr. Chad Bousman. Patrick also designed the logo, pamphlets, the poster, and the demo day presentation given his designing experience. 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nima-miryeganeh/" target="_blank">Nima</a> and I created the backend 
    using Python. I deployed it as a lambda function with a serverless architecture on AWS. I taught Nicholas and Elzaane 
    some basics of working with Amazon RDS service as they were in charge of cleaning and transforming the data from the sources
    into a relational model for the backend to use.</p>

    <p>
    I created a positive atmosphere and a balance during the development of the project where every one felt useful, always having
    something meaningful to do while not being overwhelmed by the amount of work left. 
    I made sure that everyone had freedom of decision making in their sub-team while having clear boundaries for who should do what.
    We managed to create a complete working prototype while perfectly meeting the deadline with not much pressure.
    On the last night before the demo day, I called for a last brainstoriming meeting to plan the presentation. We summarized 
    what is the problem we are solving and to reflect and enumerate the most important strengths of our solution. Patrick and 
    Elzaane did a fantastic job of presenting the project to the judges and the general public on the demo day.
    </p>

    <p>What I took from doing this project was much more about leadership and soft skills in general than experimenting and learning
    technical skills such as AWS.</p>

    <p>P.S. I just noticed that the names of three team members (Nima, Masoud, and me) are removed from the development team
    list, basically not giving us credit for what we did for the project. It is quite immoral, isn't it? </p>

    <p>I co-founded Nivad Cloud startup as a BaaS solution offering secure in-app purchases as its first and 
    most successful and innovative service. I learned and practiced a huge deal of soft skills while 
    managing this project ranging from negotiations, to conflict resolution, to making engaging presentations, 
    to customers, to basic financial management, and how to wear multiple hats but not too many. We sponsored
    PyCon in Tehran as well as a nation-wide hackathon which I did the negotiations for. Also, 
    I made great progress in my technical skills as well. I designed and developed the RESTful API up to 
    best practices and the industry standards, created the front-end and backend of the management dashboard, 
    designed the database, and deployed the service on the servers. I had an amazing journey from starting 
    a hobby side project to growing it into a successful startup serving thousands of customers in production.</p>
    
    <p>From a technical view, I had an amazing learning experience in a variety of backend development and
    maintenance as well. I learned how to set up an Nginx reverse proxy, keep services alive on docker,
    and how to manage SSL certificates. I had to separate API and the users' dashboard separate to achieve
    higher availability and much higher performance for the API. I learned how to properly use redis key-value
    store to lower the overheads on API calls to make them as fast as possible without losing any accounting data.
    I also used it to cache the results of sluggish queries. I learned how to leverage Celery to run computationally
    intensive tasks asynchronously as well as running periodic tasks such as issuing invoices and processing 
    transactions at the end of the day. </p>

    <p>This is one of the most influential projects on my professional path. I gained plenty of technical 
    skills and soft skills. But more importantly, I expanded my network, came out of my bubble and communicated 
    with people of quite different backgrounds (as customers, investors, job applicants, etc). I developed an 
    entrepreneurial/business vision which even helped me to be successful in the stock market today. Overall, 
    despite all the mistakes and shortcomings, I believe that this project made me stronger and wiser.</p>
